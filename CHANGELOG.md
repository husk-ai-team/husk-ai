## [0.8.0] — Correctness pass: replay, redaction, and the ingest path — 2026-08-09

An audit of performance, bugs, and features, and the fixes for what it found. Four of the
defects below were reproduced before being fixed, and every one of them now has a regression
test. Two behaviour changes to be aware of: a run stays `running` until its root span closes
(it used to report `success` as soon as any span finished), and the run WebSocket sends its
backlog as a single `span.replay.batch` frame instead of one `span.replay` per span.

### Fixed — correctness
- **Replay no longer re-runs your old code.** The replay module cache was keyed on
  path alone despite a docstring claiming otherwise, pinning the first version of an
  agent for the life of the backend process. The core loop — analyze, apply the
  proposed fix to the source, replay to verify — silently re-executed the *pre-fix*
  module. Now keyed on path + mtime.
- **Secret redaction missed several key formats.** `sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}` stopped at
  the first hyphen, so OpenRouter (`sk-or-v1-…`) and OpenAI project (`sk-proj-…`)
  keys passed through in the clear — OpenRouter being a provider Husk itself
  supports. Groq (`gsk_…`) and GitHub (`github_pat_…`) formats were not covered at all.
- **Span attributes bypassed redaction entirely.** Only prompts, completions, and
  error payloads were scrubbed, yet `attrs` is persisted, served over the API and
  WebSocket, and included in `husk-ai export` — the bundle the docs recommend
  attaching to bug reports. Attributes are now redacted, except the `husk.` namespace
  which Husk reads back operationally.
- **`PRAGMA foreign_keys` / `WAL` / `synchronous` were never applied to the async
  engine** — i.e. to the entire running application; only the sync engine got them.
  `ON DELETE CASCADE` therefore never fired, and every ingest commit paid a full fsync.
- **Runs reported `success` while still running.** Any finished span completed the
  whole run, so a live agent showed as finished — which also made the Studio skip the
  live WebSocket and freeze the timeline mid-flight. A run now completes when its
  root span closes.
- **Token counts arriving on a later export were dropped.** Streaming LLM spans often
  end before their usage is known; the update path ignored it, so those runs
  under-reported tokens and cost permanently. Updates now apply a delta, so
  re-exports stay idempotent.
- **The run WebSocket could lose spans.** History was read before subscribing,
  leaving a window in which an arriving span reached nobody. It now subscribes first
  and de-duplicates.
- **Fire-and-forget auto-debug tasks could be garbage-collected mid-analysis** — no
  strong reference was held. The one-shot guard set is also bounded now.
- **`_replay_lock` covered only checkpoint resumes**, leaving the re-invoke paths to
  race on the same cached module's globals. Its stated rationale was also wrong.

### Fixed — performance
- **Ingest was N+1**: one `SELECT` per span, and OTel exports up to 512 spans per
  batch. Replaced with a single bulk id lookup.
- **Studio JS bundle cut from 1,091 kB to 508 kB** (gzip 375 → 163) by importing
  `PrismLight` with just the JSON grammar instead of all ~200 Prism languages.
- **The span list and WebSocket backlog were unbounded** and each span carries full
  prompt and completion text. Both are now capped, and the backlog ships as one frame
  instead of one per span.
- **Removed redundant indexes** on the span/run write path (`run_id` and `started_at`
  were each covered by an existing composite index).
- **The runs search box fired a request per keystroke**, each a `LIKE '%…%'` table
  scan. Debounced.
- **Background tabs kept polling** on Settings (3s) and Onboarding (2s); the
  pause-when-hidden rule had only been applied to Dashboard and Runs.

### Added
- **`husk-ai delete <run_id>`** and `DELETE /api/v1/runs/{run_id}` — remove a single
  run and everything attached to it. Previously the only option was `husk-ai clean`,
  which wipes the entire database. Replays forked from the deleted run are kept and
  lose only their parent pointer. Destructive, so the endpoint sits behind the
  loopback guard that the read routes do not use.
- **`AGENTS.md`** — a complete setup runbook written for an AI assistant to follow, so you can
  point Codex / Claude Code / Cursor (or any chatbot) at the repo and be walked through install
  one command at a time. Written to work even when the assistant has no shell of its own: every
  step carries the literal output that means it worked, so it verifies your paste-back instead
  of guessing. The README shows the prompt to paste.

### Documentation
- Fixed four links in `docs/replay.md` that all resolved to the README instead of the engine
  source, the benchmark, and Getting started.
- `docs/errors-and-insights.md` → **`docs/failed-runs.md`**, and linked from the docs index and
  the README. It was orphaned, and "insights" named a feature 0.7.0 removed. `docs/ai-layer.md`
  was also missing from the docs index.
- Removed the Postgres paragraph from `docs/security.md` — that path left with the multi-tenant
  layer in 0.7.0.
- Documented three caveats that were previously written down nowhere in English: the loopback
  guard covers ingest / replay / debugger but not the read routes, `0600` on `secrets.json` has
  no Windows equivalent, and OpenRouter has no environment-variable key fallback.
- `docs/mcp.md`: added the missing `dashboard_summary` tool, the `lovable` remote client, and
  the `--transport http` path. `docs/cli.md`: dropped an unverifiable semconv version pin.
- README now states that the benchmark's 100% replay success is 118/118 replays of the failed
  runs in a 500-run workload, not 500/500.

### Fixed
- `husk-ai start` logged `Husk starting on…`; it now says `husk-ai starting on…`.
- `husk-vscode-hook`'s `package` script hardcoded a `0.1.0` filename while the package was at
  `0.2.0`. Dropped the `--out` flag so vsce derives the name and the drift cannot recur.

### Removed
- `benchmark/COST_MATRIX.md` — stale generated output from a superseded, smaller run that
  contradicted the canonical `hero_metrics.json` on both the bypassed-token total and the
  provider. Regenerate it any time with `benchmark/cost_matrix.py`.
- A dead `husk = { workspace = true }` entry in the root `[tool.uv.sources]`; the distribution
  is named `husk-ai` and nothing depends on it.

## [0.7.0] — Back to a single-user development debugger

Husk is, again, an interactive debugger you use while building an AI agent, before production —
for a single Product Manager debugging their own agent, not a team. The production-observability /
multi-user direction has been reversed.

### Repositioned
- **Single-user, local-first, development-time.** No login, no accounts, no project switcher, no
  team dashboard. The Studio opens straight onto the agent you're building on this machine.
- **Development-only, enforced in code.** Trace ingest is loopback-only, so only an agent running
  on this machine can stream in — a production deployment on another host is refused. Husk cannot
  be pointed at production by design.
- **The AI debugs for you.** The automatic debugger reads a failed run and tells you, in plain
  language, what went wrong and what to change — on one click, or automatically the moment a run
  fails.

### Removed from the public product (moved to a private enterprise edition)
- User accounts + login, teams, projects, per-project ingest API keys, the project switcher, the
  "Connect your team" settings, and the keyed networked-ingest path.
- The production-analytics layer: over-time cost/failure insights, anomaly cards, and the grounded
  chatbot, plus the over-time Errors-analysis page.

### Kept
- Multi-model attribution (which model handled each step, and its cost, within a run),
  modify-and-replay (resume from the broken step, skipping upstream token cost), and local-first /
  zero data retention.

## [0.6.0] — Zero-boilerplate native replay: `@husk.node` / `HuskAgent`

The gap this closes: the headline modify-and-replay feature (resume a run from any
node with edited state, skipping the upstream nodes) required hand-wiring ~150
lines of OTel/snapshot/`replay_from` plumbing onto Husk's engine. This release
collapses that into two decorators.

### `@husk.node` / `HuskAgent`
- New `husk_shared.agent.HuskAgent`: decorate plain `(state) -> delta` functions
  with `@agent.node` and get full node-skip modify-and-replay (the token-bypass
  primitive) — the OTel root span, per-node `graph_node` telemetry with state
  diffs, topology attributes, snapshot store, and `invoke` / `replay_from` are all
  generated. `husk.graph_module` is resolved automatically from the agent's
  module-global name.
- `examples/husk_thread.py` shrinks from ~150 lines of boilerplate to its two node
  functions plus the decorators.
- The replay dispatcher (`replay/graph_replay.py`) learns to drive a decorated
  agent (marked `_husk_agent`) — finding `invoke` / `replay_from` on the agent
  object — without changing how it drives module-level functions or LangGraph's
  `invoke(state, config=)` convention.

## [0.5.1] — Container image (GHCR) + onboarding & polling polish

### Packaging
- **Container image on GitHub Packages.** A multi-stage `Dockerfile` (Node builds
  the Studio bundle, which is gitignored; a uv/Python stage runs the backend that
  serves it) and a tag-triggered workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`)
  publish `ghcr.io/husk-ai-team/husk-ai` on every `vX.Y.Z` tag, using the built-in
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` — no secrets. `docker run -p 7654:7654 -v husk-data:/data
  ghcr.io/husk-ai-team/husk-ai`. README documents the loopback caveat (great for
  the Studio + same-network capture; cross-host ingest still wants a local install).

### Onboarding
- **No more port footgun.** `husk-ai start` records the bound port to
  `~/.husk/port`, and `demo` / `replay` default to it (fallback 7654) — so they
  reach the backend even when `start` auto-bumped off a busy 7654.
- `husk-ai demo` now points to the next step (`husk-ai mcp install` + the new
  paste-in `AGENT_PROMPT.md`), and `husk-ai doctor` prints a short "next steps"
  block. Added `AGENT_PROMPT.md` (a ready-to-paste prompt that makes a coding
  assistant actually use Husk's MCP tools when debugging).

### Performance
- The Studio's Runs and Dashboard pages stop polling while the browser tab is
  hidden (one-line `document.hidden` guard) — no wasted requests in the background.

## [0.5.0] — OpenRouter debugger provider + example state-diff telemetry

### Debugger
- **OpenRouter provider** (`debugger/providers.py`): the BYOK auto-debugger now
  supports OpenRouter alongside Anthropic and OpenAI, so you can debug a run with
  the same provider it ran on (Husk's own benchmark runs on OpenRouter Llama).
  OpenAI-compatible call path (Bearer auth, classic `max_tokens`); `GET
  /api/debugger/providers` now returns `anthropic, openai, openrouter`. Added
  context-window / output metadata (`husk_shared/model_metadata.py`) for the
  `meta-llama/*`, `openai/*`, and `anthropic/*` OpenRouter model ids.

### Example
- **`examples/husk_thread.py` now demonstrates per-node state.** It wires the engine
  telemetry hook (`on_node`) so each node emits a `graph_node` span carrying
  `state_before` / `state_after` / `state_diff`, and records the linear topology on
  the root span. The Studio's per-node **State diff** view and node graph now
  populate from the bundled example (previously the example emitted no state). Fixed
  the post-run hint, which pointed at the Vite dev URL (`:5174`) instead of the
  running backend.

### Tests
- OpenRouter provider call-shape + registry tests. Suite: 112 passing.

## [0.4.0] — Security hardening, dead-code removal, terminal/CI workflow

### Security
- **Replay RCE closed.** `/api/replay` imported and executed a graph-module path
  taken from stored run data with no auth. Added a shared loopback + Origin guard
  (`api/_guard.py`) on the replay / OTel-ingest / debugger routers, and a
  `graph_module` allowlist in `replay/graph_replay.py` (cwd or
  `$HUSK_ALLOWED_GRAPH_DIRS`) so only trusted project files can be imported.
- **At-rest hardening.** `~/.husk` is created `0700` and `traces.db` `0600`; an
  opt-out redaction pass (`HUSK_NO_REDACT=1`) scrubs common key/token shapes from
  ingested prompts/completions/tool I/O before they are persisted.
- Removed all `husk.dev` references (CORS allow-list, landing page, Studio footer,
  package metadata) — links now point at the GitHub repository.

### Zero-friction capture + terminal/CI
- **`husk_shared.instrument()`** — one call wires OpenTelemetry export to Husk
  (lazy OTel import, no new hard dependency); `llm_span()` sets the GenAI attrs.
- **`husk run <command…>`** runs your agent and captures it in one step (auto-starts
  the backend, sets `$OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, prints the run URL).
  **`husk replay <run_id>`** and **`husk export <run_id>`** bring replay and portable
  run bundles to the shell and CI.

### Studio
- Run **search + status filters**, a **Recent failures** dashboard tile, and the
  **Errors** tile deep-links to the filtered view. **Replay is gated**: runs without
  a graph module show a clear explanation instead of a `400`.

### Cleanup
- Deleted the dead legacy `husk run` / sandbox execution path (~8k LOC); `husk-sandbox`
  is now just the HTTP cassette. Removed the inert `auto_apply` config. Pruned 50
  unused Studio components and 35 unused frontend dependencies.

### Tests
- Security regressions (replay-RCE allowlist, loopback guard, ingest redaction),
  `instrument()` / CLI / runs-filter tests, and end-to-end flows (capture→read,
  BYOK debugger with a mocked LLM, replay on Husk's own engine). Suite: 110 passing.

## [0.3.0] — Automatic LLM debugger (BYOK) + node-graph visualization

### Automatic debugger (bring your own key)

- **BYOK provider layer** (`husk_studio_backend/debugger/providers.py`): a small
  provider abstraction over pure `httpx` (no new SDK deps) with Anthropic and
  OpenAI implementations and a one-line registry to add more. The user picks the
  provider and model; the model's context window (`husk_shared/model_metadata.py`)
  sizes the context budget.
- **Local-first key handling** (`debugger/secrets.py`): the key lives only in
  `~/.husk/secrets.json` (chmod 0600 on POSIX) with an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` /
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` env fallback. It is never logged, never written into traces or
  exports, and `GET /api/debugger/config` returns `has_key` only — never the key.
  Provider calls go straight from the local backend to the provider, never through
  a Husk server.
- **Failure-focused context assembler** (`debugger/context_assembler.py`): builds
  the LLM input from a run — topology, executed path, per-node state + diff, tool
  calls, model calls (prompt/response/tokens), exceptions/stack traces, and the
  recursion-limit signal. Big traces are windowed: full detail around the failure,
  far regions summarized or dropped to fit the selected model's window — the
  failure region is never cut.
- **Shipped, versioned system prompt** (`debugger/system_prompt.py`): instructs
  symptom-vs-cause reasoning, walking back to the first divergence, failure
  classification, and strict JSON output. Output is validated with a forbid-extra
  Pydantic schema and a tolerant extractor (`debugger/schemas.py`); fabricated
  trace content and silent guessing are forbidden.
- **Propose, don't apply.** `POST /api/debugger/runs/{id}/analyze` runs on demand;
  auto-analysis of failed runs is opt-in and **off by default**. A proposed fix is
  shown as a diff; applying it (`/apply-fix`) requires an explicit confirm and the
  off-by-default "allow applying fixes" toggle, writes a `.husk-bak` backup, and is
  atomic (clean apply or nothing). Reports persist in a new `debug_reports` table.

### Agent visualization (UI + structured data layer)

- **Structural per-node data.** The engine (`husk_shared/engine.py`) gained an
  optional, no-op-by-default telemetry hook; the example agent uses it to emit a
  `graph_node` span per node carrying before/after state, the state diff, and (on
  exceptions) a stack trace, with the node's model/tool spans nested under it. Graph
  topology is written onto the root span. This data now exists in the trace rather
  than being reconstructed.
- **Per-node graph API** (`GET /api/v1/runs/{id}/graph`): nodes with status
  (success / error / **skipped** / running), per-node state + diff, model and tool
  calls, tokens, timing, the detected failure point, edges (incl. conditional
  edges/labels when recoverable), and the attached debugger report.
- **Node-graph UI**: a new dependency-free SVG graph view in the run detail page —
  state-colored nodes, a highlighted failure point, arrowed/labeled edges, a
  per-node context panel (input/output, prompt/response, errors, before/after state
  diff), a Timeline/Graph toggle, and the debugger report overlaid on the
  implicated nodes. A BYOK panel was added to Settings.
- **No recording-format bump.** `debug_reports` is a brand-new table created by
  `create_all`; it does not change the shape of `runs`/`spans`/`branches`, so
  `RECORDING_FORMAT_VERSION` stays at 1 and old/new DBs stay mutually readable.

## [0.2.0] — Husk's own replay engine

### The modify-and-replay primitive is now Husk's own

- **Husk's own checkpoint/replay engine** (`husk_shared.engine`): a small,
  framework-agnostic linear executor plus a local SQLite snapshot store. After
  each node a snapshot of the merged state is persisted; `replay_from` reloads the
  snapshot before a fork node, applies a patch, and re-runs exactly that node and
  its successors — the upstream nodes are never called, so they emit no spans and
  consume no tokens. The primitive no longer depends on any agent framework.
- **Core rebuilt as Husk's own.** The replay endpoint is `/api/replay`
  (`api/replay.py`), the dispatcher is `replay/graph_replay.py`, and the engine
  emits `husk.*` telemetry (`husk.thread_id`, `husk.node`). The benchmark graph
  and the bundled `examples/husk_thread.py` run on the native engine.
- **Republished benchmark, measured on Husk's engine.** The committed canonical
  run (`benchmark/fixtures/canonical_run/`) and hero numbers are regenerated from
  a 500-parent / 118-replay run on Husk's own engine (OpenRouter Llama-3.3-70B +
  3.1-8B, TriviaQA, seed 42): **42.07%** mean token bypass [35.65, 48.81],
  token-weighted 55.0%, median **6.9×** wall-time speed-up, **100%** replay
  success (118/118), max single bypass **90.7%**. Metric definitions, the BCa
  bootstrap, the Wilson interval, and the offline reproduce harness are unchanged;
  `benchmark/reproduce.py` passes against the new fixture.
- **Framework integrations stay.** Husk still traces agents built with LangChain
  and LangGraph via the sandbox integrations; those plugins and the framework
  labels are untouched.

## [0.1.0] — hardening pass

### Correctness — the core promise

- **Offline-reproducible hero numbers.** The published figures (token bypass,
  median speed-up, replay success) required a live API key and
  an uncommitted `~/.husk/traces.db`. The canonical run is now frozen into a
  committed, version-stamped fixture (`benchmark/fixtures/canonical_run/`), and
  `benchmark/reproduce.py` regenerates and **asserts** every figure offline with
  no key, no network. Guarded by `benchmark/tests/test_reproduce.py` and a CI
  job.
- **Determinism tests that go red on drift.** `benchmark/tests/test_determinism.py`
  records a real run (canned LLM) and asserts a resume re-runs *exactly* the fork
  node + its successors, with zero variance across repeats.
  `packages/husk-sandbox/tests/test_cassette_sdk.py` drives the real OpenAI SDK
  through a cassette and asserts a replay touches **zero** network and is
  byte-identical.
- **Honest, reproducible metrics.** `hero_report.py` now computes cost/tokens
  from authoritative per-span counts (the stored rollup was a stale `$0`),
  excludes replay children from the parent count (the disclosed 617→500 quirk),
  and sorts samples before its seeded BCa bootstrap so the numbers — CI bounds
  included — are byte-reproducible from any DB or fixture with the same data.
  Hero point estimates are unchanged.

### Model-free, deterministic replay (new)

- **HTTP cassettes** (`packages/husk-sandbox/cassette.py`): record provider HTTP
  at the httpx transport boundary (shared by the OpenAI/Anthropic/Groq SDKs)
  keyed by a stable request hash; replay serves the recorded response with no
  network — deterministic, byte-identical, $0. A changed request misses and
  falls through to the live provider, then is recorded. Wired into the research
  graph (`HUSK_RECORD_CASSETTE` / `HUSK_REPLAY_CASSETTE`) and the replay endpoint
  (`use_cassette`). The M1 `http_proxy.py` stub is now a thin façade over it.

### Recording format

- **Versioned recordings** (`husk_shared.recording`): every trace DB is stamped
  with `RECORDING_FORMAT_VERSION` in `PRAGMA user_version`. On open, the backend
  refuses a DB written by a newer Husk (loud `RecordingFormatError`) and runs a
  registered migration chain for an older one, instead of silently misreading it.

### Backend & architecture

- **Branches are first-class.** `/api/v1/branches` (was a 501 stub) now creates
  (idempotently) and lists parent→child replay links, each reporting
  `token_bypass_pct` / tokens / cost saved. The replay endpoint records the
  branch automatically once the child run is ingested. `/api/v1/diff` (was a
  stub) returns a real run-vs-run diff.
- **Dead code removed.** `replay/engine.py` (a `NotImplementedError` stub nothing
  imported) is gone; the real dispatcher is `replay/graph_replay.py`.
- **Strict types.** `mypy --strict` now actually runs (a duplicate `tests`
  package had been aborting it) and passes across the package surface; the
  public API is annotated (no bare `dict`/`Any` returns). CI enforces it.

### Studio (UI/UX)

- The replay **lineage** and **token bypass** — the product's core story — are
  now visible: a run shows its replays (and its parent, if it is one) with
  bypass %, tokens, and cost saved, plus a real parent-vs-replay **diff**.
- The replay view gains a **Model-free** toggle (cassette replay) and links
  straight to the new run with its bypass once recorded.
- Removed the two dead buttons ("Rewind to here", "Compare runs"); "Compare" is
  now the diff. Added Studio unit tests (vitest).

### CI / DX / docs

- CI now runs **ruff + mypy + pytest + an offline benchmark smoke** (Python
  matrix) and **tsc + vitest + build** (Studio), and syncs the `examples` group
  so the determinism/model-free tests actually run.
- Added the missing `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- Pricing table gained the OpenRouter `meta-llama/*` IDs the benchmark used.
- Reconciled the public docs (README, benchmark README) to the single canonical
  measured run, and added this changelog; committed the previously-untracked
  `benchmark/` harness. (Internal working notes and pitch/DD materials are kept
  out of the public tree.)
