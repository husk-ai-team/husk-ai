"""Husk's own checkpoint/replay engine (linear MVP).

This module is the substrate behind Husk's modify-and-replay primitive. Earlier
versions of Husk delegated resume to LangGraph's time-travel
(``update_state(..., as_node=predecessor)`` followed by ``invoke(None)``); Husk
now owns that mechanic with a small, framework-agnostic executor plus a local
SQLite snapshot store. Nothing here depends on LangGraph, OpenTelemetry, or the
network: nodes are plain callables and snapshots live in a local file.

Scope (MVP): linear node chains, which is all the benchmark graph needs. A node
is a callable ``(state) -> delta`` returning a partial-state dict. The executor
runs nodes in order, merges each delta into a running state dict (last-write-wins,
matching LangGraph's default non-reducer channels), and writes a snapshot after
every node. ``resume`` reloads the snapshot taken after a fork node's predecessor,
applies a patch, and re-executes exactly the fork node and its successors -- the
upstream nodes are never called, so (when each node emits its own telemetry) they
produce no spans and consume no tokens. That bypass is what the token metric
measures; the engine earns it by simply not calling the skipped nodes.

Deliberately deferred (see README / MIGRATION): general-DAG topologies (a
topological order over explicit edges) and a LangGraph compatibility adapter for
arbitrary user graphs.
