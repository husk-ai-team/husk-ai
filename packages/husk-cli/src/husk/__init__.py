"""Package version, read from installed metadata.

Hardcoding it here meant it drifted from pyproject.toml: the 0.8.0 release bumped
every manifest but left this at "0.7.0", so `husk-ai --version`, `doctor`, and the
`husk_version` field of every export bundle all reported the previous release.
Reading the installed distribution's metadata makes pyproject.toml the only place a
version is written.
